Note: For garaunteed performance of this tool, all facet-based models should be made watertight before use.

Recent additions:

* Group names can now be altered using the `rename_group` method. Like so:

  ```
  slicer.rename_group(<group_id>,<new_group_name>)
  ```
* A new file can be exported using the slicer:

  ```
  # a warning will be issued if the new file name matches that of the one in use
  slicer.write_file(<new_filename>)
  ```
  
* A new GUI using iPython widgets. See the example in the examples folder.

**Note: GH will not fully render the notebook with widgets so they won't be visible unless the notebook is run locally.**
